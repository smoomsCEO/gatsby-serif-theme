Reps spend hours every month digging through CRMs and spreadsheets looking for useful intelligence. This information evolves over time, and needs a dedicated system engineered for speed and designed for ease of use.

## So. Many. Clicks.

Here's the situation: you're a new sales rep and your manager has asked you to send 60 hypercustomized emails a day to generate more meetings. 

You're running through tasks, shooting emails to all kinds of prospects. You're based in New York and sell only to financials. 

The next guy on your email list was born and raised in Copenhagen: Aha! You fuzzily recall EMEA closing an awesome deal with a Danish wind power statup, but that's all you know.

Here are the options right now:

1. New tab, Google '(your company) Denmark'
2. Go to the CRM, spreadsheet, or portal where use cases live and find that wind startup... or was it solar?
3. Slack some smart people
4. Pull a salesforce report of all Closed Won opportunities where billing address contained "Denmark NOT London" from the past year

Careful reps spend a lot of time gathering command over these use cases and stories, and inevitably spend a ton of time jumping through unnecessary hurdles memorizing this stuff.
