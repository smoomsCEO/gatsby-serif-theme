Value propositions come in different iterations, each effective in their own zones. The 'value-add landscape' is a visible representation of the ways an organization helps its customers.

## Smooms is a garden

A beautifully curated organic space where each value proposition basks in all its glory; labeled and organized. 

Pocketed knowledge of the garden is invaluable while outbounding in the wilds. 

You can recognize which kinds of soil are fertile for different specimens, produce examples of your high-yield crops growing in similar conditions, and leverage the esoteric expertise of the gardeners to explain how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Except its an on-demand delivery service for strategic intelligence

A regular garden cannot deliver infinite replications of itself upon request. But smooms does.

Imagine having the garden at your fingertips: at the press of a button, a drone comes in and delivers exactly what you asked for. 

The garden can be periodically updated when there is a new product, customer win story, or restructuring of a value-add.
