Integrations always take longer than we want them to. Errors, misalignments, and human error can add up to a massive headache, especially when you're counting on that software to hit your numbers.

## None of that is needed for smooms

Your integrations should help you with the precision apsects of selling. Use them to figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to use them. Sales is a balance between speed and precision, and smooms is 10x faster than any solution currently available. 

Smooms deals exclusively with the 'what' in 'the now'. Not the 'why'. 

## But there is a smoomsAPI because we get it

Sometimes, you really need to automate certain processes and we support this fully. We won't manage or integrate anything, but the API is there for any companies tech-savvy enough to think of a use for it.
