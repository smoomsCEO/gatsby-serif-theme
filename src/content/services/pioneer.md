Stories are the most potent form of human communication. Effective outbounding strategies tell them as often and effectively as possible.

# State of The World 

Sales and marketing teams already know stories are the most effective messages to use with prospects. But their arsenals are diverse, because sometimes you need to pull out a raw product spec instead of a story, or vice versa.

As products, companies, and value-add landscapes become increasingly digitized and abstract, a significant dimension of sales enablement is continually educating reps on products, features, and recent customer win stories. 

Companies already have these stroies stored away somewhere either in the CRM, LMS or sales automation SaaS tools. These systems provide insufficient access to this intlelligence. 

## There is room for process improvement in corporate storytelling
The best sales reps tell hard-hitting stories on the fly. Different stories work well for different targets, and companies with many customers or complex products need somewhere to store these stories where employees can learn them. 

CRMs, the enterprise embodiment of the 'jack of all trades, master of none' paradigm, are the natural first choice. Fully scalable and integratable, there is a mind-boggling variety of phenomenal CRM plugins that automate everything from sending emails to building marketing dashboards. 

The other choice... spreadsheets. Horrific.

## We love automation, but it has never brought you closer to the finish line
No system is currently designed for <i>delivering</i> this kind of information quickly and thoughtlessly. Making it actionable. Usable, and easy to search through. 

Automatic sales services are **critical** for the modern outbounding strategy, but sales and marketing copywriting is focused on influencing people, not computers. For now. 

## Inevitably, somewhere, human finesse and artistry are required to make an effective point
Outbound sales, much like life in general, requires balancing speed and precision. The data age brings both, but we are still at the dawn of Industry 4.0. 

The technology powering CRMs and intelligence delivery systems are built for precision and integration, not speed and ease of human use.
